Setting Up C++ Compile and Run Tasks in VS Code for Competitive Programmers.

This guide will help you configure tasks in Visual Studio Code to compile and run your C++ programs with input and output files, which is particularly useful for competitive programming.

Steps to Configure Tasks:

1) Open VS Code and navigate to the Terminal menu.

2) Open Configure Tasks:

3) Go to Terminal in the top menu.
4) Select Configure Tasks....
5) Create a new task:

In the dropdown that appears, choose Create tasks.json file from template.
Select Others from the list of task templates.
Modify tasks.json:

Replace the content of tasks.json with the following configuration:



{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Compile and run",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "",
      "args": [
        "copy",
        "\"${file}\"",
        "${workspaceFolder}\\jspwTest.cpp",
        "&&",
        "g++",
        "jspwTest.cpp",
        "-o",
        "jspwTest",
        "&&",
        "jspwTest",
        "<",
        "input.txt",
        ">",
        "output.txt",
        "&&",
        "del",
        "jspwTest.exe",
        "&&",
        "del",
        "jspwTest.cpp"
      ],
      "presentation": {
        "reveal": "silent"
      },
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "problemMatcher": {
        "owner": "cpp",
        "fileLocation": [
          "relative",
          "${workspaceRoot}"
        ],
        "pattern": {
          "regexp": "^(.*):(\\d+):(\\d+):\\s+(warning|error):\\s+(.*)$",
          "file": 1,
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3,
          "severity": 4,
          "message": 5
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}





Usage
Prepare Input File:

1) Create an input.txt file in the same directory as your C++ source file.
2) Add the necessary input data for your program.
3) Compile the C++ Program:

4) Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+B or Cmd+Shift+B on macOS).
5) Type Tasks: Run Task and select Compile C++.
6) Run the Program with Input and Output Files:

Open the Command Palette again.
Type Tasks: Run Task and select Run C++ with Input and Output.
Check Output:
Open the output.txt file in the same directory to see the program's output.
